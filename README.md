### Hello!
I'm Andrey, a web developer with experience in both frontend and backend development. I recently completed an intensive course covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Git. 
Through hands-on projects, I've gained valuable skills in building responsive client-side apps and APIs. I'm adept at taking projects from conception to deployment.
